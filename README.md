The application is hosted on [LINK](https://harshcoder-assignment-fyle.netlify.app/). The application was built using ReactJS. Axios is used to fetch data from openlibrary.org. Ant Design is used for styling and creating loader components. React Router is used to route through the web page.

## Features of the application 

1. The home page of the Library app has a search box which allows user to search books by book title or author name.
2. Only 10 results are fetched at a time. User can click on `Next` or `Previous` to see next or previous results.
3. The search key is visible in the search box and user can clear it.
4. It also has a list of 5 subjects in the Home page, clicking on which the page will route to a /<subject> URL which lists the top 10 books on the subject.
5. User can also input a subject to fetch the books of that particular subject.
6. A loader component is shown when API call is in progress.

It took me approximately 1.5 days to complete the assignment.
